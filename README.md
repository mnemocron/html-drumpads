#### Disclaimer

This is horrendously ugly code. My lazy buttocks has never leart how to propperly code any of the _interwebbz_ langages. These unintelligible lines of spaghetti code appear to be written in Javascript and are guaranteed to give you no less than 3 mildly disorienting headaches (I take no responsibility for the sudden urge to throw your computer out of the window). 
The combination of hardcoded statements, no database and a squeeze of cucumber juice will make you question how a mutated atrocity of this proportion can go undetected by the [clean code secret police](https://clean-code-developer.com/). 
If you plan to build upon this project, I highly advise you to have adequate insurance, a reserve of 2-3 metric fucktons of coffee and a printed door hanger that says: 
`"Screams and other noises of despair emitted from this room are completely normal and no sign to be worried"`
